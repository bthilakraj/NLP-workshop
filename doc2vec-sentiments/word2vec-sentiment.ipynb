There's so much text data out there (news articles, wikipedia, the ENTIRE INTERNET), so deep learning seems like a natural solution to a lot of problems in NLP. In this notebook, we'll explain why you can't just throw an RNN at a model and explore real-world problems in dealing with deep learning for sentiment analysis. We'll try to classify sentiment in IMDB movie reviews. (http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/)."

    "### Feeding Data to Doc2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "Doc2Vec (the portion of `gensim` that implements the Doc2Vec algorithm) does a great job at word embedding, but a terrible job at reading in files. It only takes in `LabeledLineSentence` classes which basically yields `LabeledSentence`, a class from `gensim.models.doc2vec` representing a single sentence. Why the \"Labeled\" word? Well, here's how Doc2Vec differs from Word2Vec.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec simply converts a word into a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doc2Vec not only does that, but also aggregates all the words in a sentence into a vector. To do that, it simply treats a sentence label as a special word, and does some voodoo on that special word. Hence, that special word is a label for a sentence. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we have to format sentences into\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[['word1', 'word2', 'word3', 'lastword'], ['label1']]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`LabeledSentence` is simply a tidier way to do that. It contains a list of words, and a label for the sentence. We don't really need to care about how `LabeledSentence` works exactly, we just have to know that it stores those two things -- a list of words and a label.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we need a way to convert our new line separated corpus into a collection of `LabeledSentence`s. The default constructor for the default `LabeledLineSentence` class in Doc2Vec can do that for a single text file, but can't do that for multiple files. In classification tasks however, we usually deal with multiple documents (test, training, positive, negative etc). Ain't that annoying?\n",
    "\n",
    "So we write our own `LabeledLineSentence` class. The constructor takes in a dictionary that defines the files to read and the label prefixes sentences from that document should take on. Then, Doc2Vec can either read the collection directly via the iterator, or we can access the array directly. We also need a function to return a permutated version of the array of `LabeledSentence`s. We'll see why later on."
